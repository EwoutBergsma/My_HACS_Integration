In this repo I am learning and documenting how to make a Home Assistant Custom Integration. A few prequisites before you get started:
- You need to have Home Assistant installed. You can find instructions here: https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/
- Secondly, in your Home Assistant instance, you need to install the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS). This is carefully explained here: https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/08/21/hacs-the-best-way-to-share-community-made-projects/#how-to-install

Once the above two prequisites are met, you should be able to open the HACS interface through IP:8123/hacs. For some homeassistant.local:8123/hacs should work.


# Adding the Custom Repository
The most right top button with the three dots is the menu button in the HACS interface. Click it and select "Custom Repositories". In the dialog that opens, you can add this repository (or any other of your liking) as a custom repository.
